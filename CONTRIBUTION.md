## Contribution
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

There are 3 main kinds of contributions we are actively looking for:
1. Healthcare providers, researchers, and other health stakeholders
2. Software developers and other health information technology stakeholders
3. Human and other sentient beings
### 1. For Healthcare Personnel & Researchers
There are many ways to contribute and get involved. Here are a few we need support in:
- Better ways to measure and test performance
- Suggestions on features to develop and include
- Identifying errors in how calculations & predictions are made
- Suggestions for new diseases and conditions to include
- Development of symptom matrices, and case vignettes for patients
- Testing and auditing of models and decision making algorithms

We also encourage you to think of any other ways you would love to contribute!
### 2. For Developers

##### We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, have discussions, as well as accept pull requests.

Then push your code to Github and make a pull request for a merge.

##### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

##### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Elsa-Health/elsa-models/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. (TODO: Add Example)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.


### 3. For Humans and other beings
Send us emails or tweet us (@elsa.health) with you grandest ideas on how we can achieve a disease free and healthy future for humanity.
